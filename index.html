	<h1>Responsive HTML Gallery</h1>
	<p>This is a responsive image gallery I made a long time ago. It's come in quite handy over the years, and I thought others might find it useful as well. It features five images, but, of course, more can be added as necessary. This is designed primarily as a portfolio, with images acting as links to other resources, but it can also be used with a lightbox effect (not included in this code).
